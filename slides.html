<h1> Magda! Magda!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- John! Oh, God! What's happened?
</h1>
<h1>- I'm hurt.
</h1>
<h1>- Mother, get something quick. John is hurt!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Is it bad?
</h1>
<h1>- I don't know. Where is it, John?
</h1>
<h1>- Fool! fool!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Here, it's my leg. It isn't serious, but it hurts.
I had to run on it all the way home.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Mother, close the window.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Is this the only place?
Thank God, it isn't too bad.
But how did it happen? Answer me!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> What else for us but sorrow.
You may as well tell us the truth.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Was it the Police? Answer me!
It was the police, wasn't it?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Yes, of course.
</h1>
<h1>- And they shot at you.
I knew this would happen, I knew it.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Oh, John what have you done?
Oh, John, think of your child!
Haven't we had enough troubles already?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Oh! All this hating will never bring home
but long sleepless, nights.
</h1>
<h1>- Oh, John, what have you done?
Oh, John, must all my life be this waiting,
fearing, counting the hours, dreading the knock at my door?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> I was given orders to go to Nana's place
for a secret meeting.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Shortly after midnight,
the leader called our names, and we were all there.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> I still don't know who could have betrayed us.
Not one among us of that I'm sure.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Sudden in the night
we heard the noise of cars and the screech of brakes.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Out the garret window and down the slanting roofs,
we made our escape.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> They shot at us from the street.
Marcus was hit, he fell, rolled down the shingles.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Even from up there we heard the thump
as he hit the pavement.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Oh, when will all this sorrow end?
Damn you, you and all your friends!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Why don't you men bring home some bread
and not only fear and blood?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> A million dead cannot feed your child.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Oh, Mother, be quiet!
What is the use of wailing like that, what is the use?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Yes, yes, I shan't say any more.
</h1>
<h1>- Do you see anything?
</h1>
<h1>- Why, John? Did anyone follow you?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- I don't know.
</h1>
<h1>- Did anyone recognize you?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> I don't know,
but we must be ready for anything.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Oh, bitter love, this love of freedom,
that locks the very air we breathe,</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> this love that keeps its champions burrowing
in the darkness like moles.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Magda, Magda, do not fail me.
The seed needs darkness to spread its bitter roots.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> This we must do so that one day
our son may see with innocent eyes
the flower we nourish in bitter darkness.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Quick, John! The Police!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Shall we ever see the end of all this?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> I'm not thinking of us old people,</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> but of all our children and their sons.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Shall they ever see the end of all this...
</h1>
<h1>- Ssh! Mother, please, be quiet!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Yes, I know.
Patience has become the virtue of the young.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> But we old people have seen too many tears,</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> we have seen too much blood,</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> we have seen too much betrayal.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> We can no longer keep our silence!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Even death seems too slow
in granting us our rest.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- What is your name?
</h1>
<h1>- Magda Sorel.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- And the old woman?
</h1>
<h1>- My mother.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- When did you see your husband last?
</h1>
<h1>- Two weeks ago.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Two weeks ago? Do you expect me to believe that?
</h1>
<h1>- You heard her!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Yes, indeed,
but we like to give people a second chance.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Where is your husband?
</h1>
<h1>- I don't know.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- When do you expect him back?
</h1>
<h1>- I don't know.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Is this your child?
</h1>
<h1>- Yes.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- What a sickly looking, baby... and his father away!
Is this his jacket?
</h1>
<h1>- Yes.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Very interesting... very...</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- And why don't you expect him back?
</h1>
<h1>- I never said that.
I only said that I don't know where he is.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> John is a good boy.
What do you want from him, anyway?
Why don' t you leave us alone?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- I wasn't speaking to you, Madame.
</h1>
<h1>- Yes, Mother, please...
</h1>
<h1>- All right, all right...</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Mrs. Sorel, your husband has many friends.
We're interested in his friends,</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> we would like to learn their names.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Yes, we could leave you alone,
if you would prove to be of help.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Yes, you can help us
crush the enemies of the State.
--   Well, then?
Answer me!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> I don't know.
I don't know anything...</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Mrs Sorel, to be courageous is often a very selfish thing.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> You have a mother, and a husband, and a sweet little child.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> You love them very much, don't you?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Courage is often a lack of imagination.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> We have strange ways to make people talk.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Oh, not at all the way you may think.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> All we have to do is
to quicken the beat of your heart.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> The heart is a very frail thing.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> People like you can disregard pain.
People like you can defy strength.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> But not the beat of your own heart...</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Think it over, Mrs. Sorel</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> We shall see each other again.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Don't move yet. Wait.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Have they gone, Mother?
</h1>
<h1>- Not yet. Don't move.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- John, are you all right?
</h1>
<h1>- Yes, but haven't they gone yet?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Don't move John, don't move!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Here they come!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- They're taking Michael the shoemaker away!
</h1>
<h1>- The poor devil! What could he have done?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Who knows!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> His wife is crying,
clinging on to his coat sleeve...
They cannot get her away from him.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Oh, I cannot look any longer.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Oh God,
how long must women cry over man's destiny</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Have pity on man,
this bit of clay wet with women's tears.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Have they gone, Mother?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Not yet... Wait. Don't move. Yes, they have gone.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- And now... What is to be done now?
</h1>
<h1>- You must be strong.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- You're going to leave us, is that it?
</h1>
<h1>- Yes.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Where will you go, my love?
</h1>
<h1>- I must try to cross the frontier.
</h1>
<h1>- Cross the frontier?
But when?
</h1>
<h1>- Tonight!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Tonight? Oh, John, no!
Not tonight, John, please!
Where can you go tonight, bleeding and lame?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Tomorrow may be too late.
I must not lose this chance.
To wait is to betray my cause...</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Look at your feverish eyes.
They'll burn in the darkness and signal to your enemy.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> This is my only chance:
to go before the hunter's net is laid,
--
to hide my path and keep the goal unknown
until the work is done.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Oh, no John! Wait!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Not tonight! No, John. I won't let you go.
Mother, please don't let him go!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Yes, Magda!
John is right... He must go now.
But God will join us again.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Go to the Consulate tomorrow.
Tell them our story.
Ask them for help.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Tell them what I've done.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> They will not bolt their doors
to my wife and my mother and my little son.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> To whom shall I call for help if all should fail?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> No one.
You must not ever call on my friends.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Your every move may be watched.
Their work and their lives may be endangered.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Forget their faces, forget their names.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> But how shall I know here you are?
Who'll bring me news of you?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Listen carefully: when a child on the street throws a stone
and breaks this window,
that will be a signal.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Call Assan the glasscutter,
and ask for a new pane.
He will bring you news of me.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Let me kiss my son.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Now, oh lips, say goodbye.
The word must be said,
but the heart must not heed.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> So, my lips, say goodbye.
The rose holds the summer in her winter sleep.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> The sea gathers moonlight
where ships cannot plough</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> and so will the heart retain endless hope
where time does not count,
where words cannot reach.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Let no tears, no love laden tears,
dim the light that charts our way.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Leave the tears to the starless one
who wanders without a compass in the night.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> So, within the heart,
let hope be the haven that words cannot reach.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Heart, do not listen, lest you surrender.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Parting turns time into tears,
turns hearts into clocks.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Be like the sleeper
who knows that his dream is a dream.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Next!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Yes... What can I do for you?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- My name is Mister Kofner...
</h1>
<h1>- I believe we've seen you before.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Oh yes, yesterday and the day before yesterday,
and the day before, and every day for oh, so long...</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> It isn't our fault if you never bring
the necessary documents.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> I know, I know. It isn't your fault.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Did you bring your birth certificate?
</h1>
<h1>- Yes.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Did you bring your health certificate?
</h1>
<h1>- Yes.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- ... and your vaccination?...
</h1>
<h1>- Yes.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- ... and your affidavit?...
</h1>
<h1>- Yes.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- ... and the statement from the bank?...
</h1>
<h1>- Yes.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- ... your passport?...
</h1>
<h1>- Yes.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- ... three photographs?
</h1>
<h1>- Yes.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> But, Mr. Kofner!
These are not the right size,</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> I told you... they must be three by three.
Besides, this paper must be notarized.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> For God's sake!...
When will it be right?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Well, well, Mr. Kofner.
After all, it isn't our fault...</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> I know, I know, it isn't your fault...</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> There is a notary around the corner.
He can do it for you right away.
The photos you can bring tomorrow.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Oh, yes, tomorrow... and the day after tomorrow...
and the day after and every day for, oh, so long!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Next!
Next!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Go ahead...
</h1>
<h1>- Oh, sì, sì... Buon giorno.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Yes... What can I do for you?
Well, then...</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Scusi, Signorina, ma io non capisco...</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Oh dear! You... you «non capisco», eh?
</h1>
<h1>- No.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Is there anyone in this room who can understand her?
</h1>
<h1>- I do. I believe I can help her.
Parlate pure. buona donna.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Grazie!
Mio Signor, io vengo per mia figlia, l'unica mia creatura...
</h1>
<h1>- It's something about her daughter...</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Fuggí da casa con un dei vostri soldati
quando era ancora una bambina...
</h1>
<h1>- It seems that she ran away with one of your soldiers.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Per tre anni non ebbi sue notizie; la cercai dappertutto
</h1>
<h1>- For almost three year she had no news of her
and couldn't find out where she was.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Avevo ormai perduta ogni speranza
di rivedere la mia Giulia,
ma stamani la lettera é arrivata...
... e così mi scrive la mia povera bambina.
</h1>
<h1>- This morning, at last,
she received a letter from her daughter.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- "Mamina, mi sono ammalata, e temo di morire.
</h1>
<h1>- It seems she's very ill...
And afraid to die...</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Mio marito m'abbandonata..
con un piccino di tre mesi in questo paese straniero"
</h1>
<h1>- Her husband left her with a little boy.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- "Mamma, vieni! Ho tanto bisogno del tuo aiuto."
</h1>
<h1>- She asks her mother to go there
and help her out of trouble.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> È proprio così che mi scrive la mia povera bambina.
Immagini la mia pena.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Well... and what can we do for her?
</h1>
<h1>- La signorina domanda che cosa desidera.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- "Che cosa desidero?"
Io voglio andar vicino a la mia Giulia
e prendere cura del piccino!
</h1>
<h1>- She wants to go to see her daughter Giulia,
and to take care of her new grandson.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Tell her that first of all,
she must fill out this application.
</h1>
<h1>- Deve fare la domanda.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Sì... e poi?
</h1>
<h1>- ... and then if it is accepted,
she must apply for a visa.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Ma quando potró partire?
</h1>
<h1>- When will she be able to leave?</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> It may be a couple of months...
... it may be three... four...
It all depends if and when she's granted a visa.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Forse in un paio di mesi.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Un paio di mesi! Ma, signorina, mia figlia è molto ammalata.
Bisogna ch'io vada di lei subito!
</h1>
<h1>- Her daughter is very, very sick. She needs her right away.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Nothing I can do!
</h1>
<h1>- Per piacere, signorina,
abbia compassione d'una povera mamma</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Bisogna aver pazienza.</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Next!</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> Hello?
Oh! It's you...
Yes, but not now... Bye-bye! Yesss...
Yes?</h1>

The wife of Sorel, the lover of freedom.</h1>

</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1> My life is in danger.
They hover like hawks, the Secret Police

<div class="slide">
<h1>- My husband secretly fled to your country.

</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>- Yes, he did to escape the Police.
</h1>

<div class="slide">
<h1>- No, no... listen... you don't understand.
John is a hero, a lover of freedom.

Explain to the Consul, explain!

My name is Nicholas Magadoff,
the world-famous magician.
</h1>
<h1>- I'm sorry.
I never go to the theatre.</h1>

<div class="slide">
<h1> Obviously!
Nevertheless, would you mind

The light goes pale and thin.
The heart is dead.</h1>

Oh, give us back the earth and make us free.</h1>
