	<strong>ACT I &nbsp;</strong><br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>&nbsp;Scene 1</strong><br>
	<br>
	<em>(The scene is the home of John Sorel, a small, shabby<br>
	apartment in a large European city. The apartment is<br>
	above the street level and is entered by a door at the<br>
	extreme left. A centre window overlooks the street<br>
	and an alcove at the extreme right leads the rest of the<br>
	apartment. In the recess leading to the window are the<br>
	kitchen sink and the gas stove. There is a telephone on<br>
	the stool below the cupboard, and a cradle near the<br>
	entrance of the alcove.<br>
	When the curtain rises, the room is empty and dark. It<br>
	is early morning, the windows are open, and the music<br>
	of a record played in a café on the street can be heard.<br>
	A dim light in the alcove throws across the wall the<br>
	shadows of the moving figures within the alcove.)</em><br>
	<br>
	VOICE ON RECORD<br>
	Tu reviendras et voudras<br>
	M'enfermer dans tes bras.<br>
	Moi il faudra que je songe<br>
	A te cacher les sombres<br>
	mensonges<br>
	de ma Vie, parce-que tu<br>
	reviendras...<br>
	Ah, pauvre toi,<br>
	La verité tu ne sauras<br>
	jamais...<br>
	<br>
	<em>(The outer door is flung open and John stumbles into<br>
	the room. He clutches at the workbench for support and<br>
	upsets it. It falls with a great crash of tools, throwing<br>
	John to the floor, Painfully, he drags himself to a chair<br>
	and lies across it, gasping for breath, as the record<br>
	begins to play again.)</em><br>
	<br>
	VOICE ON RECORD<br>
	Tu reviendras...<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	Magda! Magda!<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	(Magda rushes in from the alcove, followed by the<br>
	Mother. Magda goes immediately to John and helps<br>
	him sit in the chair. She kneels, rips open the trouser<br>
	leg and examines the wound.)<br>
	John! Oh, God! What's happened?<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	I'm, hurt.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Mother, get something quick. John is hurt!<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	Is it bad?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	I don't know. Where is it, John?<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	(The Mother goes into the alcove, returning<br>
	immediately with a basin of water and bandages.<br>
	She takes them to Magda)<br>
	Fool! fool!<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	Here, it's my leg. It isn't serious, but it hurts.<br>
	I had to run on it all the way home.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Mother, close the window.<br>
	<br>
	(The Mother closes the window, shutting out the sound<br>
	of the record. As she bathes and cleans the wound)<br>
	<br>
	Is this the only place?<br>
	Thank God, it isn't too bad.<br>
	But how did it happen? Answer me!<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	What else for us but sorrow.<br>
	You may as well tell us the truth.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Was it the Police? Answer me!<br>
	It was the police, wasn't it?<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	Yes, of course.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	And they shot at you.<br>
	I knew this would happen, I knew it.<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	Oh, John what have you done?<br>
	Oh, John, think of your child!<br>
	Haven't we had enough troubles already?<br>
	Oh!All this hating will never bring home<br>
	but long sleepless, nights.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Oh, John, what have you done?<br>
	Oh, John, must all my life be this waiting,<br>
	fearing, countingthe hours, dreading theknock at my door?<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	I was given orders to go to Nana's place<br>
	for a secret meeting.<br>
	Shortly after midnight,<br>
	the leader called our names, and we were all there.<br>
	I still don't know who could have betrayed us.<br>
	Not one among us of that I'm sure.<br>
	Sudden in the night<br>
	we heard the noise of cars and the screech of brakes.<br>
	Out the garret window and down the slanting roofs,<br>
	we made our escape.<br>
	They shot at us from the street.<br>
	Marcus was hit, he fell, rolled down the shingles.<br>
	Even from up there we heard the thump<br>
	as he hit the pavement.<br>
	<br>
	(Magda helps John remove his raincoat<br>
	and hangs it on the wall rack)<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	Oh, when will all this sorrow end?<br>
	Damn you, you and all your friends!<br>
	Why don't you men bring homesome bread<br>
	and not only fear and blood?<br>
	A million dead cannot feed your child.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Oh, Mother, be quiet!<br>
	What is the use of wailing like that, what is the use?<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	(Despairingly, the Mother goes to the window<br>
	to keep watch.)<br>
	Yes, yes, I shan't say any more.<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	(To Mother)<br>
	Do you see anything?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Why, John? Did anyone follow you?<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	I don't know.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Did anyone recognize you?<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	I don't know,<br>
	but we must be ready for anything.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	(in angry despair)<br>
	Oh, bitter love, this love of freedom,<br>
	that locks the very air we breathe,<br>
	this love that keeps its champions burrowing<br>
	in the darkness like moles.<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	Magda, Magda, do not fail me.<br>
	The seed needs darkness to spread its bitter roots.<br>
	This we must do so that one day<br>
	our son may see with innocent eyes<br>
	the flower we nourish in bitter darkness.<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	(From the windows)<br>
	Quick, John! The Police!<br>
	<br>
	(For an instant all three are frozen with panic. Magda<br>
	instinctively puts her arms protectively around John.<br>
	Then he indicates that they must help him to the agreed<br>
	hiding place. The two women half carry him into the<br>
	alcove, and while the Mother holds the curtain aside,<br>
	Magda helps John climb onto the roof The Mother<br>
	hurries to right the overturned workbench. Magda<br>
	draws the curtains of the alcove and runs to gather up<br>
	the basin, the cloths, and the medicine bottle. Carrying<br>
	these, Magda goes at help the Mother set the table in<br>
	place. The Mother hurries to the bureau, finds some<br>
	papers there that must be concealed, finally hides them<br>
	under the blankets of the cradle and drags the cradle<br>
	over to her chair, into which she sinks heavily. Magda<br>
	carries the basin and other things into the alcove and<br>
	returns with her sewing basket, seating herself at the<br>
	dining table. With feigned calm, the two women await<br>
	the entrance of the police. The Mother suddenly sees<br>
	the bloodstains on the floor. She signals to Magda, who<br>
	tries frantically to wipe them away with her skirt. The<br>
	Mother hands Magda the shawl from the cradle. Magda<br>
	cleans away the stains, hands back the shawl, for a<br>
	moment is too exhausted to move, then forces herself<br>
	to sit calmly at the table. The door is flung open and the<br>
	Secret Police Agent rushes in, followed immediately by<br>
	two plain-clothes men. The Secret Police Agent directs<br>
	the two men to search the apartment. They search the<br>
	alcove, check the window, emptying out the drawers of<br>
	the workbench and the bureau, scattering clothes and<br>
	paper all over the floor.)<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	Shall me ever see the end of all this?<br>
	I'm not thinking of us old people,<br>
	but of all our children and their sons.<br>
	Shall they ever see the end of all this...<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Ssh! Mother, please, be quiet!<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	Yes, I know.<br>
	Patience has become the virtue of the young.<br>
	But we old people have seen too many tears,<br>
	we have seen too much blood,<br>
	we have seen too much betrayal.<br>
	<br>
	(One of the men is directed to search Magda, then both<br>
	are sent to wait outside.)<br>
	<br>
	We can no longer keep our silence!<br>
	Even death seems too slow<br>
	in granting us our rest.<br>
	<br>
	POLICE AGENT<br>
	(To Magda, from the door)<br>
	What is your name?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Magda Sorel.<br>
	<br>
	POLICE AGENT<br>
	And the old woman?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	My mother.<br>
	<br>
	POLICE AGENT<br>
	(The Police Agent questions them with unctuous<br>
	courtesy, pacing nervously about the room, kicking<br>
	the clothes that have been dumped from the bureau<br>
	drawers.)<br>
	When did you see your husband last?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Two weeks ago.<br>
	<br>
	POLICE AGENT<br>
	Two weeks ago? Do you expect me to believe that?<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	You heard her!<br>
	<br>
	POLICE AGENT<br>
	Yes, indeed,<br>
	but we like to give people a second chance.<br>
	Where is your husband?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	I don't know.<br>
	<br>
	POLICE AGENT<br>
	When do you expect him back?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	I don't know.<br>
	<br>
	POLICE AGENT<br>
	Is this your child?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Yes.<br>
	<br>
	(The Police Agent peers into the cradle, then goes to<br>
	examine the wall rack and examines John's raincoat.)<br>
	<br>
	POLICE AGENT<br>
	What a sickly looking, baby... and his father away!<br>
	Is this his jacket?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Yes.<br>
	<br>
	POLICE AGENT<br>
	(spotting some blood in it)<br>
	Very interesting... very...<br>
	And why don't you expect him back?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	I never said that.<br>
	I only said that I don't know where he is.<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	(To Police)<br>
	John is a good boy.<br>
	What do you want from him, anyway?<br>
	Why don' t you leave us alone?<br>
	<br>
	POLICE AGENT<br>
	(ironically)<br>
	I wasn't speaking to you, Madame.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Yes, Mother, please...<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	All right, all right...<br>
	<br>
	POLICE AGENT<br>
	(resuming his unctuous tone)<br>
	Mrs. Sorel, your husband has many friends.<br>
	We're interested in his friends,<br>
	we would like to learn their names.<br>
	Yes, we could leave you alone,<br>
	if you would prove to be of help.<br>
	Yes, you can help us<br>
	crush the enemies of the State.<br>
	Well, then?<br>
	<br>
	(alter a long silence, with sudden violence)<br>
	<br>
	Answer me!<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	I don't know.<br>
	I don't know anything...<br>
	<br>
	POLICE AGENT<br>
	Mrs Sorel, to be courageous is often a very selfish thing.<br>
	You have a mother, and a husband, and a sweet little child.<br>
	You love them very much, don't you?<br>
	<br>
	(She don't speaks)<br>
	<br>
	Courage is often a lack of imagination.<br>
	We have strange ways to make people talk.<br>
	Oh, no at all the way you may think.<br>
	All we have to do is<br>
	to quicken the beat of your heart.<br>
	The heart is a very frail thing.<br>
	People like you can disregard pain.<br>
	People like you can defy strength.<br>
	But not the beat of your own heart...<br>
	Think it over, Mrs. Sorel<br>
	<br>
	(He stands over her threateningly, then suddenly<br>
	relaxes, takes his hat and goes to the door.)<br>
	<br>
	We shall see each other again.<br>
	<br>
	(The Police Agent exits very quietly and The Mother<br>
	moves swiftly at the window.)<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	(To John)<br>
	Don't move yet. Wait.<br>
	Have they gone, Mother?<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	Not yet. Don't move.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	John, are you all right?<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	(train his hiding place)<br>
	Yes, but haven't they gone yet?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Don't move John, don't move!<br>
	<br>
	(She goes to the door to see if they have gone.)<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	Here they come!<br>
	<br>
	(From across the way the loud, desperate<br>
	wailing of a woman is heard)<br>
	<br>
	They're taking Michael the shoemaker away!<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	The poor devil! What could he have done?<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	Who knows!<br>
	His wife is crying,<br>
	clinging on to his coat sleeve...<br>
	They cannot get her away from him.<br>
	Oh, I cannot look any longer.<br>
	<br>
	(She closes the window, shutting off the cries. The<br>
	Mother moves away from the window towards the<br>
	middle of the room. Magda goes at help John out<br>
	of his hiding place.)<br>
	<br>
	Oh God,<br>
	how long must women cry over man's destiny<br>
	Have pity on man,<br>
	this bit of clay wet with women's tears.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Have they gone, Mother?<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	Not yet... Wait. Don't move. Yes, they have gone.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	(Magda helps John into the room, then turns to him<br>
	suddenly to touch him, frantically and almost fiercely<br>
	they embrace.)<br>
	And now... What is to be done now?<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	You must be strong.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	You're going to leave us, is that it?<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	Yes.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Where will you go, my love?<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	I must try to cross the frontier.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Cross the frontier?<br>
	But when?<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	Tonight!<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Tonight? Oh, John, no!<br>
	Not tonight, John, please!<br>
	Where can you go tonight, bleeding and lame?<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	Tomorrow may be too late.<br>
	I must not lose this chance.<br>
	To wait is to betray my cause...<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Look at your feverish eyes.<br>
	They'll burn in the darkness and signal to your enemy.<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	This is my only chance:<br>
	to go before the hunter's net is laid,<br>
	to hide my path and keep the goal unknown<br>
	until the work is done.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Oh, no John! Wait!<br>
	<br>
	(As John goes into the alcove, Magda tries to le<br>
	restrain him.)<br>
	<br>
	Not tonight! No, John. I won't let you go.<br>
	Mother, please don't let him go!<br>
	<br>
	(The Mother embraces Magda.)<br>
	<br>
	MOTHER<br>
	Yes, Magda!<br>
	John is right... He must go now.<br>
	But God will join us again.<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	(John re-enters with more clothes and papers.)<br>
	Go to the Consulate tomorrow.<br>
	Tell them our story.<br>
	Ask them for help.<br>
	Tell them what I've done.<br>
	They will not bolt their doors<br>
	to my wife and my mother and my little son.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	(Magda moves about dazedly, attempting at help John,<br>
	but scarcely able at believe that he is leaving her.)<br>
	To whom shall I call for help if all should fail?<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	No one.<br>
	You must not ever call on my friends.<br>
	Your every move may be watched.<br>
	Their work and their lives may be endangered.<br>
	Forget their faces, forget their names.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	But how shall I know here you are?<br>
	Who'll bring me news of you?<br>
	<br>
	JOHN<br>
	(John beckons the two women to him.)<br>
	Listen carefully when a child on the street throws a stone<br>
	and breaks this window,<br>
	that will be a signal.<br>
	Call Assan the glasscutter,<br>
	and ask for a new pane.<br>
	He will bring you news of me.<br>
	<br>
	(John goes to the cradle and kneels next to it. The<br>
	Mother stands next to him)<br>
	<br>
	Let me kiss my son.<br>
	<br>
	(Magda goes to fetch John's jacket, and, still holding it<br>
	tenderly, slowly walks towards the front of the stage)<br>
	<br>
	Now, oh lips, say goodbye.<br>
	The word must be said,<br>
	but the heart must not heed.<br>
	So, my lips, say goodbye.<br>
	The rose holds the summer in her winter sleep.<br>
	The sea gathers moonlight<br>
	where ships cannot plough<br>
	and so will the heart retain endless hope<br>
	where time does not count,<br>
	where words cannot reach. Now, oh lips... ecc.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA, MOTHER, JOHN<br>
	Let no tears, no love laden tears,<br>
	dim the light that charts out way.<br>
	Leave the tears to the starless one<br>
	who wanders without a compass in the night.<br>
	So, within the heart,<br>
	let hope be the haven that words cannot reach.<br>
	Heart, do not listen, lest you surrender.<br>
	Parting turns time into tears,<br>
	turns hearts into clocks.<br>
	Be like the sleeper<br>
	who knowsthat his dream is a dream.<br>
	<br>
	(John embraces Magda, breaks away from her,<br>
	embraces his Mother, and leaves as the curtain falls.)<br>
	<br>
	Scene 2<br>
	<br>
	(Later the same day. The scene is the waiting room of<br>
	Consulate, a cheerless, coldly-lit room, furnished with<br>
	usual benches and wall desks. Downstage, from the<br>
	front of the desk extending to the back wall is a heavy<br>
	wooden railing with a swinging gate which separates<br>
	the space used by the Secretary from the rest of the<br>
	waiting room. Upstage, between the side wall and the<br>
	railing is the door to the Consul's office. The door<br>
	should massive with the upper half of semi-opaque<br>
	glass. The cornice could be surmounted by an<br>
	indistinguishable coat-of-arms or other official symbols.<br>
	The curtain rises. The Secretary is busily typing at<br>
	her desk. Mr Kofner, an elderly gentleman with a<br>
	slight professional air, and the Foreign Woman, an<br>
	old peasant, sit on the benches, waiting to be summoned<br>
	by the Secretary)<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	(The Secretary rarely looks at the applicants<br>
	as she speaks to them.)<br>
	Next!<br>
	<br>
	(Mr Kofner gets up quickly and comes at the railing.)<br>
	<br>
	Yes... What can I do for you?<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	My name is Mister Kofner...<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	I believe we've seen you before.<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	Oh yes, yesterday and the day before yesterday,<br>
	and the day before, and every day for oh, so long...<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	It isn't our fault if you never bring<br>
	the necessary documents.<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	I know, I know. It isn't your fault.<br>
	<br>
	(He places the documents on the desk as she checks<br>
	them off her list.)<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	Did you bring your birth certificate?<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	Yes.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	Did you bring your health certificate?<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	Yes.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	... and your vaccination?...<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	Yes.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	... and your affidavit?...<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	Yes.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	... and the statement from the bank?...<br>
	<br>
	(Magda enters and takes a place on the bench.)<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	Yes.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	... your passport?...<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	Yes.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	... three photographs?<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	Yes.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	But, Mr. Kofner!<br>
	These are not the right size,<br>
	I told you... they must be three by three.<br>
	Besides, this paper must be notarized.<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	For God's sake!...<br>
	When will it be right?<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	Well, well, Mr. Kofner.<br>
	After all, it isn't our fault...<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	I know, I know, it isn't your fault...<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	(handing back the documents to him one by one)<br>
	There is a notary around the corner.<br>
	He can do it for you right away.<br>
	The photos you can bring tomorrow.<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	(returning slowly to his seat)<br>
	Oh, yes, tomorrow... and the day after tomorrow...<br>
	and the day after and every day for, oh, so long!<br>
	<br>
	(Anna Gomez enters. She is young, thin, frantically<br>
	nervous. Slashed through her dark hair is a bizarre<br>
	streak of pure white. From time to time, her arm is<br>
	grotesquely pulled by a sudden tic. She attempts to<br>
	disguise the movement by pushing her hand through<br>
	the streak in her hair. After a moment's hesitation,<br>
	she takes her place on the waiting bench.)<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	Next!<br>
	<br>
	(impatiently)<br>
	<br>
	Next!<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	(To the Foreign Woman)<br>
	Go ahead...<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN<br>
	(She goes to the roiling.)<br>
	Oh, sì, sì... Buon giorno.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	Yes... What can I do for you?<br>
	<br>
	(The Foreign Woman shrugs her shoulders helplessly)<br>
	<br>
	Well, then...<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN<br>
	Scusi, Signorina, ma io non capisco...<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	Oh dear! You... you «non capisco», eh?<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN<br>
	No.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	Is there anyone in this room who can understand her?<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	(He gets up and comes the Foreign Woman<br>
	to translate for her)<br>
	I do. I believe I can help her.<br>
	Parlate pure. buona donna.<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN<br>
	Grazie!<br>
	Mio Signor, io vengo per mia figlia, l'unica mia creatura...<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	It's something about her daughter...<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN<br>
	Fuggí da casa con un dei vostri soldati<br>
	quando era ancora una bambina...<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	It seems that she ran away with one of your soldiers.<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN<br>
	Per tre anni non ebbi sue notizie; la cercai dappertutto<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	For almost three year she had no news of her<br>
	and couldn't find out where she was.<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN<br>
	Avevo ormai perduta ogni speranza<br>
	di rivedere la mia Giulia,<br>
	ma stamani la lettera é arrivata...<br>
	<br>
	(She produces precious letter from her bosom.)<br>
	<br>
	... e così mi scrive la mia povera bambina.<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	This morning, at last,<br>
	she received a letter from her daughter.<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN<br>
	(reading from the letter)<br>
	"Mamina, mi sono ammalata, e temo di morire.<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	It seems she's very ill...<br>
	And afraid to die...<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN<br>
	Mio marito m'abbandonata..<br>
	con un piccino di tre mesi in questo paese straniero"<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	Her husband left her with a little boy.<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN<br>
	"Mamma, vieni! Ho tanto bisogno del tuo aiuto."<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	She asks her mother to go there<br>
	and help her out of trouble.<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN<br>
	È proprio così che mi scrive la mia povera bambina.<br>
	Immagini la mia pena.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	Well... and what can we do for her?<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	(To the Foreign Woman)<br>
	La signorina domanda che cosa desidera.<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN<br>
	"Che cosa desidero?"<br>
	Io voglio andar vicino a la mia Giulia<br>
	e prendere cura del piccino!<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	She wants to go to see her daughter Giulia,<br>
	and to take care of her new grandson.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	Tell her that first of all,<br>
	she must fill out this application.<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	(To the Foreign Woman)<br>
	Deve fare la domanda.<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN<br>
	Sì... e poi?<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	... and then if it is accepted,<br>
	she must apply for a visa.<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN<br>
	Ma quando potró partire?<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	When will she be able to leave?<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	It may be a couple of months...<br>
	<br>
	(The Foreign Woman tries desperately at<br>
	follow the words she does not understand.)<br>
	<br>
	... it may be three... four...<br>
	It all depends if and when she's granted a visa.<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	(To the Foreign Woman)<br>
	Forse in un paio di mesi.<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN<br>
	(stunned by this information)«Un paio di mesi?<br>
	» Ma, signorina, mia figlia è molto ammalata.<br>
	Bisogna ch'io vada di lei subito!<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	Her daughter is very, very sick. She needs her right away.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	(shaking her head to make her meaning clear)<br>
	Nothing I can do!<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN<br>
	Per piacere, signorina,<br>
	abbia compassione d'una povera mamma<br>
	<br>
	(The Secretary hands the Foreign Woman the<br>
	application as Mr Kofner leads her away to the writing<br>
	desk to help her with it. After a while he regains his<br>
	seat, but the Foreign Woman will remain at the desk<br>
	painfully filling out the form until the end of the act.)<br>
	<br>
	Mr KOFNER<br>
	(To the Foreign Woman)<br>
	Bisogna aver pazienza.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	Next!<br>
	<br>
	(Magda crosses to the railing. The Magician enters,<br>
	followed by Vera Boronel. They take their places on<br>
	the benches The telephone rings. The telephone rings<br>
	again.)<br>
	<br>
	Hello?<br>
	<br>
	(The call is obviously not business. She immediately<br>
	adopts a babyish voice.)<br>
	<br>
	Oh! It's you...<br>
	<br>
	(She laughs coquettishly)<br>
	<br>
	Yes, but not now... Bye-bye! Yesss...<br>
	<br>
	(She puts down the phone and turns to Magda<br>
	again with a cold, efficient voice)<br>
	<br>
	Yes?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	May I speak to the Consul?<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	No one is allowed to speak to the Consul,<br>
	the Consul is busy.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Tell him my name.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	Your name is a number...<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	But my name is Sorel. Magda Sorel.<br>
	The wife of Sorel, the lover of freedom.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	Sorel is a name and a name is a number.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	May I speak to the Consul?<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	No one is allowed... to speak to the Consul,<br>
	the Consul is busy.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Tell him my story.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	And what is your story?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	My life is in danger.<br>
	They hover like hawks the Secret Police<br>
	and the spies over my house.<br>
	They leave me no peace.<br>
	Our house has been turned into a trap for my husband.<br>
	The child and I are the bait,<br>
	and the hidden hunter waits<br>
	for the heartsick panther to return.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	I don't see how we can help you.<br>
	You're not even one of our citizens.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	May I speak...<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	No one is allowed...<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	But yes, yes, only he can help me.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	And how can he help you?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	My husband secretly fled to your country.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	He has entered our country illegally?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Yes, he did to escape the Police.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	Then he is a criminal case.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	No, no... listen... you don't understand.<br>
	John is a hero, a lover of freedom.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	An irregular case.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	May I speak to the Consul?<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	(She gets up, facing Magda with increasing hostility.)<br>
	The Consul is busy.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Will you tell him my need?<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	And what is your need?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Help me to escape, escape with my child.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	You're not one of our people.<br>
	You're not our concern.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	But you are our friends,<br>
	the friends of the oppressed.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	(She goes to the filing cabinet and takes out<br>
	the necessary forms.)<br>
	We are at peace with your country.<br>
	Their laws are our laws.<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	I must see my John,<br>
	and you, only you, can help me.<br>
	May I speak to the Consul?<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	(She returns to her desk with the papers and<br>
	hands them to Magda.)<br>
	I give you these papers.<br>
	This is how to begin:<br>
	Your name is a number.<br>
	Your story's a case.<br>
	Your need a request.<br>
	Your hopes will be filed.<br>
	Come back next week...<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	And you will explain to the Consul?<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	But what is there to explain?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Explain that John is a hero,<br>
	that flowers bloom in the blood that was shed.<br>
	But the deed will be lost if the hand falls unkissed.<br>
	Explain to the Consul, explain!<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	But what is there to explain?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Explain that the web<br>
	of my life has worn down to one single thread,<br>
	and the hands of the clock...<br>
	glitter like knives.<br>
	Explain to the Consul, explain!<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	But what is there to explain?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Explain that the heart of one man<br>
	cannot be multiplied nor his life be divided,<br>
	that fate can be fixed to its diamond point<br>
	by a click of the tongue.<br>
	Explain to the Consul, explain!<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	But what is there to explain?<br>
	<br>
	MAGDA<br>
	Explain that John is a hero, e<br>
	xplain that he's my John!<br>
	Explain to the Consul, explain!<br>
	Tell him my name.<br>
	Tell him my story.<br>
	&nbsp;Tell him my need.<br>
	<br>
	SECRETARY<br>
	(as though she were explaining to a rather<br>
	slow wilted child)<br>
	Fill in these papers.<br>
	This is how to begin.<br>
	Your name is a number...<br>
	<br>
	(Dazed, Magda returns to her seat.)<br>
	<br>
	MAGICIAN<br>
	(To Vera Boronel)<br>
	I beg your pardon, Madam.<br>
	My name is Nicholas Magadoff,<br>
	the world-famous magician.<br>
	<br>
	VERA BORONEL<br>
	I'm sorry.<br>
	I never go to the theatre.<br>
	<br>
	MAGICIAN<br>
	Obviously!<br>
	Nevertheless, would you mind<br>
	if I practised one of my tricks on you?<br>
	It will help us both pass the time.<br>
	<br>
	VERA BORONEL<br>
	Oh, no, Please!<br>
	I'm afraid of tricks.<br>
	<br>
	MAGICIAN<br>
	Oh, but there is nothing to it!<br>
	Do you see this little ball?<br>
	Now you see it... now you don't. Now you see it...<br>
	<br>
	(During the quintet, the sunlight slowly fades, obscuring<br>
	the details of the room. At last only the faces of the<br>
	figures are visible, caught by the rays of light falling<br>
	through a narrow window, high out of sight on the wall<br>
	above the Secretary's desk.)<br>
	<br>
	FOREIGN WOMAN, MAGICIAN<br>
	Mr KOFNER, VERA BORONEL, MAGDA<br>
	In endless waiting rooms, the hour stands still.<br>
	The light goes pale and thin.<br>
	The heart is dead.<br>
	We wait in wide-eyed sleep.<br>
	What are we waiting for? Perhaps the creaking<br>
	of a door or the light play on the wall.<br>
	We wait forever, wait.<br>
	The answer comes too late or death too soon.<br>
	Oh, give us back the earth and make us free.<br>
	<br>
	(One by one, except for Mr Kofner,<br>
	the people rise in place)<br>
	<br>
	It is God's gift to me, this ever flowering earth.<br>
	Oh, let all flags be burned and guilt be shared.<br>
	My brother's shame be mine and his my fare.<br>
	Why must we wait in crowded rooms<br>
	while aimlessly are spun the wasted suns<br>
	and the forgotten moons?<br>
	Oh, leave the doors unlocked and light the lamps within.<br>
	The silent looms will sing,<br>
	the plough will split the rock...<br>
	Oh give us back the earth and make us free...<br>
	<br>
	(Slowly, puzzling over the form she has been given,<br>
	the Foreign Woman leaves the writing desk and<br>
	goes out through the main door. The curtain falls.)</p>
