   The Consul Libretto
   ===================

   ACT I  


    Scene 1


   VOICE ON RECORD
   Tu reviendras et voudras
   M'enfermer dans tes bras.
   Moi il faudra que je songe
   A te cacher les sombres
   mensonges
   de ma Vie, parce-que tu
   reviendras...
   Ah, pauvre toi,
   La verité tu ne sauras
   jamais...


   VOICE ON RECORD
   Tu reviendras...

   JOHN
   Magda! Magda!

   MAGDA
   John! Oh, God! What's happened?

   JOHN
   I'm, hurt.

   MAGDA
   Mother, get something quick. John is hurt!

   MOTHER
   Is it bad?

   MAGDA
   I don't know. Where is it, John?

   MOTHER
   Fool! fool!

   JOHN
   Here, it's my leg. It isn't serious, but it hurts.
   I had to run on it all the way home.

   MAGDA
   Mother, close the window.


   Is this the only place?
   Thank God, it isn't too bad.
   But how did it happen? Answer me!

   MOTHER
   What else for us but sorrow.
   You may as well tell us the truth.

   MAGDA
   Was it the Police? Answer me!
   It was the police, wasn't it?

   JOHN
   Yes, of course.

   MAGDA
   And they shot at you.
   I knew this would happen, I knew it.

   MOTHER
   Oh, John what have you done?
   Oh, John, think of your child!
   Haven't we had enough troubles already?
   Oh!All this hating will never bring home
   but long sleepless, nights.

   MAGDA
   Oh, John, what have you done?
   Oh, John, must all my life be this waiting,
   fearing, countingthe hours, dreading theknock at my door?

   JOHN
   I was given orders to go to Nana's place
   for a secret meeting.
   Shortly after midnight,
   the leader called our names, and we were all there.
   I still don't know who could have betrayed us.
   Not one among us of that I'm sure.
   Sudden in the night
   we heard the noise of cars and the screech of brakes.
   Out the garret window and down the slanting roofs,
   we made our escape.
   They shot at us from the street.
   Marcus was hit, he fell, rolled down the shingles.
   Even from up there we heard the thump
   as he hit the pavement.


   MOTHER
   Oh, when will all this sorrow end?
   Damn you, you and all your friends!
   Why don't you men bring homesome bread
   and not only fear and blood?
   A million dead cannot feed your child.

   MAGDA
   Oh, Mother, be quiet!
   What is the use of wailing like that, what is the use?

   MOTHER
   Yes, yes, I shan't say any more.

   JOHN
   Do you see anything?

   MAGDA
   Why, John? Did anyone follow you?

   JOHN
   I don't know.

   MAGDA
   Did anyone recognize you?

   JOHN
   I don't know,
   but we must be ready for anything.

   MAGDA
   Oh, bitter love, this love of freedom,
   that locks the very air we breathe,
   this love that keeps its champions burrowing
   in the darkness like moles.

   JOHN
   Magda, Magda, do not fail me.
   The seed needs darkness to spread its bitter roots.
   This we must do so that one day
   our son may see with innocent eyes
   the flower we nourish in bitter darkness.

   MOTHER
   Quick, John! The Police!


   MOTHER
   Shall me ever see the end of all this?
   I'm not thinking of us old people,
   but of all our children and their sons.
   Shall they ever see the end of all this...

   MAGDA
   Ssh! Mother, please, be quiet!

   MOTHER
   Yes, I know.
   Patience has become the virtue of the young.
   But we old people have seen too many tears,
   we have seen too much blood,
   we have seen too much betrayal.


   We can no longer keep our silence!
   Even death seems too slow
   in granting us our rest.

   POLICE AGENT
   What is your name?

   MAGDA
   Magda Sorel.

   POLICE AGENT
   And the old woman?

   MAGDA
   My mother.

   POLICE AGENT
   When did you see your husband last?

   MAGDA
   Two weeks ago.

   POLICE AGENT
   Two weeks ago? Do you expect me to believe that?

   MOTHER
   You heard her!

   POLICE AGENT
   Yes, indeed,
   but we like to give people a second chance.
   Where is your husband?

   MAGDA
   I don't know.

   POLICE AGENT
   When do you expect him back?

   MAGDA
   I don't know.

   POLICE AGENT
   Is this your child?

   MAGDA
   Yes.


   POLICE AGENT
   What a sickly looking, baby... and his father away!
   Is this his jacket?

   MAGDA
   Yes.

   POLICE AGENT
   Very interesting... very...
   And why don't you expect him back?

   MAGDA
   I never said that.
   I only said that I don't know where he is.

   MOTHER
   John is a good boy.
   What do you want from him, anyway?
   Why don' t you leave us alone?

   POLICE AGENT
   I wasn't speaking to you, Madame.

   MAGDA
   Yes, Mother, please...

   MOTHER
   All right, all right...

   POLICE AGENT
   Mrs. Sorel, your husband has many friends.
   We're interested in his friends,
   we would like to learn their names.
   Yes, we could leave you alone,
   if you would prove to be of help.
   Yes, you can help us
   crush the enemies of the State.
   Well, then?


   Answer me!

   MAGDA
   I don't know.
   I don't know anything...

   POLICE AGENT
   Mrs Sorel, to be courageous is often a very selfish thing.
   You have a mother, and a husband, and a sweet little child.
   You love them very much, don't you?


   Courage is often a lack of imagination.
   We have strange ways to make people talk.
   Oh, no at all the way you may think.
   All we have to do is
   to quicken the beat of your heart.
   The heart is a very frail thing.
   People like you can disregard pain.
   People like you can defy strength.
   But not the beat of your own heart...
   Think it over, Mrs. Sorel


   We shall see each other again.


   MAGDA
   Don't move yet. Wait.
   Have they gone, Mother?

   MOTHER
   Not yet. Don't move.

   MAGDA
   John, are you all right?

   JOHN
   Yes, but haven't they gone yet?

   MAGDA
   Don't move John, don't move!


   MOTHER
   Here they come!


   They're taking Michael the shoemaker away!

   MAGDA
   The poor devil! What could he have done?

   MOTHER
   Who knows!
   His wife is crying,
   clinging on to his coat sleeve...
   They cannot get her away from him.
   Oh, I cannot look any longer.


   Oh God,
   how long must women cry over man's destiny
   Have pity on man,
   this bit of clay wet with women's tears.

   MAGDA
   Have they gone, Mother?

   MOTHER
   Not yet... Wait. Don't move. Yes, they have gone.

   MAGDA
   And now... What is to be done now?

   JOHN
   You must be strong.

   MAGDA
   You're going to leave us, is that it?

   JOHN
   Yes.

   MAGDA
   Where will you go, my love?

   JOHN
   I must try to cross the frontier.

   MAGDA
   Cross the frontier?
   But when?

   JOHN
   Tonight!

   MAGDA
   Tonight? Oh, John, no!
   Not tonight, John, please!
   Where can you go tonight, bleeding and lame?

   JOHN
   Tomorrow may be too late.
   I must not lose this chance.
   To wait is to betray my cause...

   MAGDA
   Look at your feverish eyes.
   They'll burn in the darkness and signal to your enemy.

   JOHN
   This is my only chance:
   to go before the hunter's net is laid,
   to hide my path and keep the goal unknown
   until the work is done.

   MAGDA
   Oh, no John! Wait!


   Not tonight! No, John. I won't let you go.
   Mother, please don't let him go!


   MOTHER
   Yes, Magda!
   John is right... He must go now.
   But God will join us again.

   JOHN
   Go to the Consulate tomorrow.
   Tell them our story.
   Ask them for help.
   Tell them what I've done.
   They will not bolt their doors
   to my wife and my mother and my little son.

   MAGDA
   To whom shall I call for help if all should fail?

   JOHN
   No one.
   You must not ever call on my friends.
   Your every move may be watched.
   Their work and their lives may be endangered.
   Forget their faces, forget their names.

   MAGDA
   But how shall I know here you are?
   Who'll bring me news of you?

   JOHN
   Listen carefully when a child on the street throws a stone
   and breaks this window,
   that will be a signal.
   Call Assan the glasscutter,
   and ask for a new pane.
   He will bring you news of me.


   Let me kiss my son.


   Now, oh lips, say goodbye.
   The word must be said,
   but the heart must not heed.
   So, my lips, say goodbye.
   The rose holds the summer in her winter sleep.
   The sea gathers moonlight
   where ships cannot plough
   and so will the heart retain endless hope
   where time does not count,
   where words cannot reach. Now, oh lips... ecc.

   MAGDA, MOTHER, JOHN
   Let no tears, no love laden tears,
   dim the light that charts out way.
   Leave the tears to the starless one
   who wanders without a compass in the night.
   So, within the heart,
   let hope be the haven that words cannot reach.
   Heart, do not listen, lest you surrender.
   Parting turns time into tears,
   turns hearts into clocks.
   Be like the sleeper
   who knowsthat his dream is a dream.


   Scene 2


   SECRETARY
   Next!


   Yes... What can I do for you?

   Mr KOFNER
   My name is Mister Kofner...

   SECRETARY
   I believe we've seen you before.

   Mr KOFNER
   Oh yes, yesterday and the day before yesterday,
   and the day before, and every day for oh, so long...

   SECRETARY
   It isn't our fault if you never bring
   the necessary documents.

   Mr KOFNER
   I know, I know. It isn't your fault.


   SECRETARY
   Did you bring your birth certificate?

   Mr KOFNER
   Yes.

   SECRETARY
   Did you bring your health certificate?

   Mr KOFNER
   Yes.

   SECRETARY
   ... and your vaccination?...

   Mr KOFNER
   Yes.

   SECRETARY
   ... and your affidavit?...

   Mr KOFNER
   Yes.

   SECRETARY
   ... and the statement from the bank?...


   Mr KOFNER
   Yes.

   SECRETARY
   ... your passport?...

   Mr KOFNER
   Yes.

   SECRETARY
   ... three photographs?

   Mr KOFNER
   Yes.

   SECRETARY
   But, Mr. Kofner!
   These are not the right size,
   I told you... they must be three by three.
   Besides, this paper must be notarized.

   Mr KOFNER
   For God's sake!...
   When will it be right?

   SECRETARY
   Well, well, Mr. Kofner.
   After all, it isn't our fault...

   Mr KOFNER
   I know, I know, it isn't your fault...

   SECRETARY
   There is a notary around the corner.
   He can do it for you right away.
   The photos you can bring tomorrow.

   Mr KOFNER
   Oh, yes, tomorrow... and the day after tomorrow...
   and the day after and every day for, oh, so long!


   SECRETARY
   Next!


   Next!

   MAGDA
   Go ahead...

   FOREIGN WOMAN
   Oh, sì, sì... Buon giorno.

   SECRETARY
   Yes... What can I do for you?


   Well, then...

   FOREIGN WOMAN
   Scusi, Signorina, ma io non capisco...

   SECRETARY
   Oh dear! You... you «non capisco», eh?

   FOREIGN WOMAN
   No.

   SECRETARY
   Is there anyone in this room who can understand her?

   Mr KOFNER
   I do. I believe I can help her.
   Parlate pure. buona donna.

   FOREIGN WOMAN
   Grazie!
   Mio Signor, io vengo per mia figlia, l'unica mia creatura...

   Mr KOFNER
   It's something about her daughter...

   FOREIGN WOMAN
   Fuggí da casa con un dei vostri soldati
   quando era ancora una bambina...

   Mr KOFNER
   It seems that she ran away with one of your soldiers.

   FOREIGN WOMAN
   Per tre anni non ebbi sue notizie; la cercai dappertutto

   Mr KOFNER
   For almost three year she had no news of her
   and couldn't find out where she was.

   FOREIGN WOMAN
   Avevo ormai perduta ogni speranza
   di rivedere la mia Giulia,
   ma stamani la lettera é arrivata...


   ... e così mi scrive la mia povera bambina.

   Mr KOFNER
   This morning, at last,
   she received a letter from her daughter.

   FOREIGN WOMAN
   "Mamina, mi sono ammalata, e temo di morire.

   Mr KOFNER
   It seems she's very ill...
   And afraid to die...

   FOREIGN WOMAN
   Mio marito m'abbandonata..
   con un piccino di tre mesi in questo paese straniero"

   Mr KOFNER
   Her husband left her with a little boy.

   FOREIGN WOMAN
   "Mamma, vieni! Ho tanto bisogno del tuo aiuto."

   Mr KOFNER
   She asks her mother to go there
   and help her out of trouble.

   FOREIGN WOMAN
   È proprio così che mi scrive la mia povera bambina.
   Immagini la mia pena.

   SECRETARY
   Well... and what can we do for her?

   Mr KOFNER
   La signorina domanda che cosa desidera.

   FOREIGN WOMAN
   "Che cosa desidero?"
   Io voglio andar vicino a la mia Giulia
   e prendere cura del piccino!

   Mr KOFNER
   She wants to go to see her daughter Giulia,
   and to take care of her new grandson.

   SECRETARY
   Tell her that first of all,
   she must fill out this application.

   Mr KOFNER
   Deve fare la domanda.

   FOREIGN WOMAN
   Sì... e poi?

   SECRETARY
   ... and then if it is accepted,
   she must apply for a visa.

   FOREIGN WOMAN
   Ma quando potró partire?

   Mr KOFNER
   When will she be able to leave?

   SECRETARY
   It may be a couple of months...


   ... it may be three... four...
   It all depends if and when she's granted a visa.

   Mr KOFNER
   Forse in un paio di mesi.

   FOREIGN WOMAN
   » Ma, signorina, mia figlia è molto ammalata.
   Bisogna ch'io vada di lei subito!

   Mr KOFNER
   Her daughter is very, very sick. She needs her right away.

   SECRETARY
   Nothing I can do!

   FOREIGN WOMAN
   Per piacere, signorina,
   abbia compassione d'una povera mamma


   Mr KOFNER
   Bisogna aver pazienza.

   SECRETARY
   Next!


   Hello?


   Oh! It's you...


   Yes, but not now... Bye-bye! Yesss...


   Yes?

   MAGDA
   May I speak to the Consul?

   SECRETARY
   No one is allowed to speak to the Consul,
   the Consul is busy.

   MAGDA
   Tell him my name.

   SECRETARY
   Your name is a number...

   MAGDA
   But my name is Sorel. Magda Sorel.
   The wife of Sorel, the lover of freedom.

   SECRETARY
   Sorel is a name and a name is a number.

   MAGDA
   May I speak to the Consul?

   SECRETARY
   No one is allowed... to speak to the Consul,
   the Consul is busy.

   MAGDA
   Tell him my story.

   SECRETARY
   And what is your story?

   MAGDA
   My life is in danger.
   They hover like hawks the Secret Police
   and the spies over my house.
   They leave me no peace.
   Our house has been turned into a trap for my husband.
   The child and I are the bait,
   and the hidden hunter waits
   for the heartsick panther to return.

   SECRETARY
   I don't see how we can help you.
   You're not even one of our citizens.

   MAGDA
   May I speak...

   SECRETARY
   No one is allowed...

   MAGDA
   But yes, yes, only he can help me.

   SECRETARY
   And how can he help you?

   MAGDA
   My husband secretly fled to your country.

   SECRETARY
   He has entered our country illegally?

   MAGDA
   Yes, he did to escape the Police.

   SECRETARY
   Then he is a criminal case.

   MAGDA
   No, no... listen... you don't understand.
   John is a hero, a lover of freedom.

   SECRETARY
   An irregular case.

   MAGDA
   May I speak to the Consul?

   SECRETARY
   The Consul is busy.

   MAGDA
   Will you tell him my need?

   SECRETARY
   And what is your need?

   MAGDA
   Help me to escape, escape with my child.

   SECRETARY
   You're not one of our people.
   You're not our concern.

   MAGDA
   But you are our friends,
   the friends of the oppressed.

   SECRETARY
   We are at peace with your country.
   Their laws are our laws.

   MAGDA
   I must see my John,
   and you, only you, can help me.
   May I speak to the Consul?

   SECRETARY
   I give you these papers.
   This is how to begin:
   Your name is a number.
   Your story's a case.
   Your need a request.
   Your hopes will be filed.
   Come back next week...

   MAGDA
   And you will explain to the Consul?

   SECRETARY
   But what is there to explain?

   MAGDA
   Explain that John is a hero,
   that flowers bloom in the blood that was shed.
   But the deed will be lost if the hand falls unkissed.
   Explain to the Consul, explain!

   SECRETARY
   But what is there to explain?

   MAGDA
   Explain that the web
   of my life has worn down to one single thread,
   and the hands of the clock...
   glitter like knives.
   Explain to the Consul, explain!

   SECRETARY
   But what is there to explain?

   MAGDA
   Explain that the heart of one man
   cannot be multiplied nor his life be divided,
   that fate can be fixed to its diamond point
   by a click of the tongue.
   Explain to the Consul, explain!

   SECRETARY
   But what is there to explain?

   MAGDA
   Explain that John is a hero, e
   xplain that he's my John!
   Explain to the Consul, explain!
   Tell him my name.
   Tell him my story.
    Tell him my need.

   SECRETARY
   Fill in these papers.
   This is how to begin.
   Your name is a number...


   MAGICIAN
   I beg your pardon, Madam.
   My name is Nicholas Magadoff,
   the world-famous magician.

   VERA BORONEL
   I'm sorry.
   I never go to the theatre.

   MAGICIAN
   Obviously!
   Nevertheless, would you mind
   if I practised one of my tricks on you?
   It will help us both pass the time.

   VERA BORONEL
   Oh, no, Please!
   I'm afraid of tricks.

   MAGICIAN
   Oh, but there is nothing to it!
   Do you see this little ball?
   Now you see it... now you don't. Now you see it...


   FOREIGN WOMAN, MAGICIAN
   Mr KOFNER, VERA BORONEL, MAGDA
   In endless waiting rooms, the hour stands still.
   The light goes pale and thin.
   The heart is dead.
   We wait in wide-eyed sleep.
   What are we waiting for? Perhaps the creaking
   of a door or the light play on the wall.
   We wait forever, wait.
   The answer comes too late or death too soon.
   Oh, give us back the earth and make us free.


   It is God's gift to me, this ever flowering earth.
   Oh, let all flags be burned and guilt be shared.
   My brother's shame be mine and his my fare.
   Why must we wait in crowded rooms
   while aimlessly are spun the wasted suns
   and the forgotten moons?
   Oh, leave the doors unlocked and light the lamps within.
   The silent looms will sing,
   the plough will split the rock...
   Oh give us back the earth and make us free...
