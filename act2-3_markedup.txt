   
   VOICE ON RECORD
   Tu reviendras... 
   
   MOTHER
   Any news?
   
   MAGDA
   Nothing. Oh, that song!... again and again!       They drive me crazy.   
   
   I'm so tired... so tired. 
   Day after day, waiting in that office. 
   The Consul will not see me,       they ask for papers, 
   and then more papers,
   and then all you get is another questionnaire.    
   
   What is your name? Magda Sorel. 
   Age? Thirty-three. 
   Place of birth? Oh God, oh God!
   
   MOTHER
   Have you told them 
   that your child is sick and that you must get... 
   
   MAGDA
   It's no use, Mother, it's no use.       If I only had news of John... 
   But not a word from him,       not a word since he left. 
   
   MOTHER
   Oh no, no, Magda, one must not lose heart.
   
   MAGDA
   Only his eyes are alive. He doesn't even cry anymore.
   
   MOTHER
   He will get better, Magda, I'm sure
   
   MAGDA
   
   MOTHER
   Oh don't say that, don't say that!    
   What is the matter, little lamb?      Why are you so still?
   
   
   I've never seen a baby so little and sad. 
   Smile for Granny, little lamb. Come on. 
   Koo-roo koo koo koo! Say: 
   "Moo-moo," say "Da-da.
   " Koo-roo koo koo koo, Look who's stealing your shoe! 
   He's my baby boy, Granny's little baby boy.
   
   I shall tickle you, tickle you. 
   Tickle... Glu glu glu! 
   I've never seen a baby so little and sad. 
   Give me a little smile.
   
   
   Where is Granny? Whoopee!
   
   
   Won't you smile? 
   Come on, give a little smile to your Granny. 
   I've never seen a baby so little and sad; 
   like an old man, so wrinkled and white.
   
   
   Won't you ever smile again for your Granny?       Hoo hoo!
   
   
   I shall find for you shells and stars. 
   I shall swim for you river and sea. 
   Sleep my love, sleepfor me. 
   My sleep is old. I shall feed for you lamb and dove. 
   I shall buy for you sugar and bread. 
   Sleep my love, sleep for me. 
   My sleep is dead..
   Rain will fall but Baby won't know.
   He laughs alone in orchards of gold. 
   Tears will fall but Baby won't know. 
   His laughter is blind. Sleep, 
   my love, forsleep is kind.
   
   Sleep is kind when sleep is young. 
   Sleep for me, sleep for me. 
   I shall build for you planes and boats. 
   I shall catch for you cricket and bee. 
   Let the old ones watch your sleep. 
   Only death will watch the old. Sleep, sleep...    
   MAGDA
   John, John, why did you bring me 
   all these branches and stones?   
   
   JOHN'S VOICE
   They are to build us a cross and a grave.
   
   MAGDA
   John, John, 
   what are those bandages and what are those stains?
   
   JOHN'S VOICE
   Blood on my skin and blood on my clothes.
   
   An through the night like a wolf on a plain, 
   I've been hunted with bullets and knives. 
   Bright was the moon and far was my home.
   
   MAGDA
   John, John, 
   who is that woman that you brought back with you?
   
   JOHN'S VOICE
   She is my sister, my dear little sister.
   You must love her for she's my own blood. 
   You must give her the keys to our house.
   
   MAGDA
   John, John, 
   you never told me that you had any sisters.
   
   JOHN'S VOICE
   She's my sister, my own little sister.
   
   MAGDA
   John, John, 
   why am I afraid of that horrible woman?
   
   JOHN'S VOICE
   Heavy's her hand and cold is her mouth... 
   
   MAGDA
   
   JOHN'S VOICE
   She's my sister, my own little sister. 
   She must eat with us 
   and share our bed, salt 
   our bread, and dig our grave. 
   Welcome us, Magda welcome us home.
   
   JOHN'S VOICE
   Come, come your supper is cold. 
   The bread must be broken. The wine must be spilled.
   
   MAGDA
   Look... look. The wine has turned black 
   like blood that is shed. 
   Look John, look, John! The bread is white 
   like the flesh of the dead. John, John! 
   I'm afraid... Her eyes are so hollow, 
   her laughter is soundless and white! 
   Oh, John, send her away. 
   Your sister is death. 
   She covets my child for a grave.   
   
   JOHN'S VOICE
   Come, come. 
   Let us hide from the moon. 
   I hear the horns calling. 
   The hunt is still on.    
   
   Where is my child? I want to see my child... 
   
   MAGDA
   He is asleep. Give me your hand. 
   Walk softly, John, he is asleep.       Walk softly, John.    
   
   MAGDA
   Mother! Mother!
   
   MOTHER
   
   MAGDA
   A dream... an awful dream.
   
   MOTHER
   
   MAGDA
   He seemed so strange and so far away. 
   He asked to see the baby, and... Oh, how awful!
   
   MOTHER
   Dreams are never true, silly girl... 
   This is not like you, not like you.
   
   MAGDA
   
   MOTHER
   Why should Baby die?       Why should he? 
   Why should death claim such a little seed?
   
   MAGDA
   Mother, I'm afraid! 
   Something has happened to John. 
   I shall never see him again.    
   It is the signal!
   
   MOTHER
   The signal!
   
   MAGDA
   It is from John. They must have news from John.
   MOTHER
   Oh God be praised! At last! at last!
   
   MAGDA
   Oh Mother, what shall we do when he comes? 
   Please tell me... We cannot tell him the truth, can we? 
   He cannot help us. How could he?
   
   MOTHER
   Don't worry! 
   He surely knows how to help us. 
   He'll bring us good news. 
   
   MAGDA
   Hello. Is this Assan the glasscutter?
   This is Mrs. Sorel. 
   Will you please come to my house 
   to replace a broken pane in my window? 
   Yes. Yes. Please hurry. It is bitter cold.
   
   
   He'll be right over. 
   Mother, come... here... feel my heart.
   
   MOTHER
   Magda, oh Magda my darling,
   What is it you fear?
   
   MAGDA
   What shall we tell him? 
   How much shall we hide?
   
   MOTHER
   Magda, my darling, don't... 
   
   
   Who can it be?
   
   MAGDA
   I don't know.
   
   MOTHER
   
   MAGDA
   Don't answer.
   
   POLICE AGENT
   May I come in?
   
   MOTHER
   Shall we pretend that we could keep you out?
   
   POLICE AGENT
   The door was open... 
   
   MAGDA
   My door seems to be open to my enemies 
   and closed to my friends.
   
   POLICE AGENT
   
   MAGDA
   What do you want? Out with it.
   
   POLICE AGENT
   Now, now, Madam Sorel! 
   Don't get so excited.    
   We're not in a hurry, are we? 
   
   MOTHER
   Oh God!
   
   POLICE AGENT
   Madame Sorel, I like you very much. 
   We could be good friends. 
   
   MAGDA
   What is it you want? More money?
   
   POLICE AGENT
   Madame Sorel, you're underestimating me. 
   I like you so much that I watch you very carefully. 
   We know that you frequent a certain consulate 
   and hope to get a visa... 
   
   MAGDA
   You cannot stop me..
   
   POLICE AGENT
   Oh, but we'll never stop you. 
   On the contrary... we would like to help you.
   
   MAGDA
   What is it? More money?
   
   POLICE AGENT
   What an indelicate thing to say!    
   My dear lady, 
   the money you can give me hardly pass 
   for such a thing as silence. 
   After all, I'm a family man. 
   I must earn a living. 
   And I know a way that we could both be happy. 
   Your husband has many friends. 
   They don't come to visit you anymore. 
   So, we would like to visit them. 
   And we can make it possible 
   for you to join your husband... 
   
   MAGDA
   
   POLICE AGENT
   You will regret this. 
   How dare you, Mrs. Sorel? Mrs. Sorel! 
   
   MAGDA
   If you come near my house again, 
   in the name of God, I'll kill you!
   ASSAN
   Where is it?
   
   MAGDA
   Right there.   
   POLICE AGENT
   A pane of glass... a very fragile thing.
   It is amazing how much 
   one can see through a pane of glass. A pane of glass...    
   
   ASSAN
   Who is he? What does he want from you?
   
   MAGDA
   An agent.
   Your names... 
   ASSAN
   Why did you call me now? 
   A foolish thing to do... 
   
   MAGDA
   I didn't know he was coming. 
   I had no way to warn you.
   
   ASSAN
   I must not stay long.
   
   MAGDA
   How is John?
   
   ASSAN
   Still hiding in the mountains. 
   
   MAGDA
   Hasn't he crossed the frontier yet?
   
   ASSAN
   He will not cross it unless he knows 
   you can join him there.
   
   MAGDA
   Tell him he must not come back. 
   Tell him the house is watched. 
   Tell he must cross the frontier as soon as he can.
   
   ASSAN
   But you must hurry, hurry!
   
   MAGDA
   Tell him everything is ready. 
   Tell him we'll join him soon.
   
   ASSAN
   
   MAGDA
   
   ASSAN
   Is there anything you want to send him?
   
   MAGDA
   Yes, just a second.   
   
   MOTHER
   Assan!
   Don't tell John... 
   ASSAN
   Well, now I must go
   
   MAGDA
   When shall we see you again? 
   Tell John I send him my love.
   
   ASSAN
   I must not stay too long. 
   I shall come back when I have more news for you. 
   Goodbye.
   
   MAGDA
   Goodbye.
   Mother, why are so still, Mother? 
   Why don't you rock the cradle? 
   Why don't you sing? 
   Mother, why are so still, Mother? 
   Is my baby dead?
   Shall I call the carpenter and the priest? 
   Shall I unfold the white silk coverlet? 
   Shall I go to market to buy white roses? 
   I cannot look at him, Mother,
   but tell me that he smiles...    
   Oh, no! Not that!... 
   It is too soon to cry. 
   He may still hear us... Ssh, Mother... Ssh...    
   MOTHER
   I'm not crying for him, 
   not for us but for John, 
   who will never see his baby again; 
   but for John, my son, 
   whom I shall never see again. 
   For John, my son, whom I must leave. 
   I'm too tired to wait or to help.   
   When a heart is as old and worn 
   and patched as mine, 
   lesser things can break it 
   than the death sigh of a child. 
   Old people live for simple things: 
   to see a birth, to bury the dead. 
   But they themselves are dead. 
   They live on borrowed breath, 
   and once the thing is done, 
   they quickly crumble into dust.   
   Now let me fold my things and lock my doors. 
   I leave behind me nothing but sorrow, 
   but I believe that God receives with kindness
   the empty handed traveller.
   
   Scene 2
   
   
   SECRETARY
   What did you say your name was?
   
   ANNA
   Anna Gómez. 
   
   SECRETARY
   Oh, yes, here it is.
   
   ANNA
   Is there any hope?
   
   SECRETARY
   Three years in concentration camp. 
   Husband... prisoner. 
   Whereabouts... unknown. No documents! 
   I don't see what we can do for you.
   
   ANNA
   But something must be done! 
   I have to leave the country at the end of the month.
   
   SECRETARY
   Why?
   
   ANNA
   My permit has expired. Where am I to go?
   
   SECRETARY
   Try another consulate.
   
   ANNA
   I've been to every consulate in town. 
   Everywhere the answer is the same. 
   They don't know what to do with me, 
   and nobody cares... 
   Still, there must be a place for me 
   somewhere in this large world.
   
   SECRETARY
   Perhaps you should go back to your country.
   
   ANNA
   Do you realize what that would mean for me?
   
   SECRETARY
   Fill in this paper and come back tomorrow.
   
   ANNA, VERA, KOFNER
   Oh, yes, tomorrow, 
   and the day after tomorrow and every day.   
   SECRETARY
   Next... 
   MAGDA
   Can I speak to the Consul? 
   I must get to see him right away!
   
   SECRETARY
   I'm sorry, Madame. You must wait in line. 
   
   MAGDA
   But please, just, let me explain.
   I'm sure the gentleman wouldn't mind. 
   
   MAGICIAN
   But I do mind. 
   This is the seventh time I've come here, Madame. 
   I'm always at the end of the line. 
   I wait patiently for hours and hours. 
   When my turn finally comes, 
   it's time for the Consulate to close.
   
   MAGDA
   Oh, please, if you only knew... 
   
   MAGICIAN
   
   SECRETARY
   There are other people waiting in line.       It would upset our system!   
   Next, next!   
   Oh, thank you!
   
   MAGICIAN
   My charming Ma'moiselle, you have the honour of speaking       with no other than Nika Magadoff. 
   
   SECRETARY
   Who?
   
   MAGICIAN
   Yes, remember, Nika Magadoff! 
   Illusionist, telepathist, and prestidigitator, 
   hypnotist, ventriloquist, electro-levitator, 
   in short, the great magician! A vase? Water?   
   SECRETARY
   How did you do it?
   
   MAGICIAN
   How did I do it? 
   After all, I'm Nika Magadoff!
   The one and only Nika Magadoff! Do you mean to say 
   that you never heard of Nika Magadoff? 
   How can it be true 
   that you never heard of Nika Magadoff? 
   I'm known throughout the world, 
   I have often performed for 
   the Prince and the Princess Yusoupoff, 
   and the Duke of Alba, 
   and the Queen of Belgium, all the finest, 
   all the richest, all the noblest, all the brightest, 
   all the greatest people in the world! 
   You must have heard of me.   
   SECRETARY
   And what can I do for you?
   
   MAGICIAN
   My charming Ma'moiselle, 
   I need a visa, a simple little visa.
   
   SECRETARY
   A visa, my dear sir, is not a simple thing.
   
   MAGICIAN
   And why should it be difficult? 
   Your country should be glad 
   to receive a great artist like me!
   
   SECRETARY
   Do you have a labour permit?
   
   MAGICIAN
   A labour permit! 
   Why should I have a labour permit? 
   After all, I'm Nika Magadoff, 
   the one and only Nika Magadoff. 
   Oh, how could it be that you haven't heard of me? 
   Isn't my art a document? 
   After all, I've performed... 
   
   SECRETARY
   May I see your documents?
   
   MAGICIAN
   What! You need to see my documents?
   
   SECRETARY
   How many times must I say it! But really!
   
   MAGICIAN
   Oh, my charming Ma'moiselle, 
   why care about such things? 
   Don't you know? 
   Art is the artist's only passport. 
   Nevertheless, 
   if you're not convinced that I am Nika Magadoff, 
   I shall prove it to you! 
   Prestidigitation!    
   
   May I please borrow your watch?    
   
   ANNA, VERA 
   The man is truly an artist!
   He makes life seem so easy! 
   But I would never trust him!
   
   Mr KOFNER
   Oh, my watch! What did you do with my watch?
   Give me back my watch!
   
   MAGICIAN
   Just a moment. Don't worry.
   
   ANNA, KOFNER, VERA
   What is he up to now? We must not let him fool us.
   
   Oh, what a great magician! He truly is an artist!
   
   MAGICIAN
   After all, I've performed this for the Prince... 
   
   SECRETARY
   I've had enough of this! Where do you think you are?
   
   MAGICIAN
   You're not convinced yet? Hypnotism!   
   Look into my eyes, look into my eyes, 
   you feel tired, you want to sleep, breathe deeply!
    Breathe deeply!   
   Look into my eyes...    
   Guardami negli occhi, tu sei stanca e vuoi dormir!
   
   
   They are gone.
   What shall we make them do? 
   
   SECRETARY
   Oh, I don't know. This is most irregular!
   
   MAGICIAN
   Watch me:
   Oh, what a lovely ballroom this is! 
   Look how the floor shines with precious marble.   
   Look how the light falls bright 
   and clear from twenty crystal chandeliers! 
   Look at the crimson walls hung with golden mirrors... 
   Ah, listen! the music has begun! 
   Ah! How you'd love to dance with your loved one... 
   But where is he? 
   But where is he she? 
   There, there he is, he's bowing to you! 
   Look! there she is! 
   Bow to her! 
   What are you waiting for? 
   The floor is empty, the music sweet. 
   The dance is on!
   
   MAGDA, VERA, ANNA
   Oh, what a lovely dance! 
   Oh, the light so bright and the music sweet! 
   Oh, my love keep dancing, 
   don't ever wake me, do let me sleep! 
   When the heart is taken away, taken away! 
   When feet learn to follow lightly your way, 
   when music uncoils the day... 
   
   KOFNER, FOREIGN WOMAN
   Balla, balla e non pensare, sonno e morte son con noi... 
   
   SECRETARY
   I've had enough of this! 
   Where do you think you are? In a circus? 
   If you don't hurry and show me your documents,       I'll have you thrown out!
   
   MAGICIAN
   Oh, please, don't he angry, just a moment... 
   
   SECRETARY
   Oh dear me!
   
   Wait! I'll find them. I know they must be here. 
   Just a moment!
   
   SECRETARY
   I've never seen such confusion. 
   I want to see your documents.
   
   MAGICIAN
   
   SECRETARY
   And what am I supposed to do with it?
   
   MAGICIAN
   Hold it.
   
   SECRETARY
   Look what you have done now!
   
   MAGICIAN
   Just a moment... just a moment... 
   
   SECRETARY
   Can't you stop those people?    
   Oh! Good heavens! Stop it!
   
   MAGICIAN
   I know they must be here. Be patient, please... 
   
   SECRETARY
   How long am I supposed to hold this?
   
   MAGICIAN
   Just a minute! Just a minute!
   
   SECRETARY
   Stop those people! 
   They drive me crazy! 
   Stop them! Help! Help! 
   
   MAGICIAN
   Please don't get excited!    
   
   Wake up! Thank you very much!
   
   
   Svegliati!   
   SECRETARY
   Hurry, hurry and gather up those things! 
   What if the Consul should come in! Oh, what confusion! 
   You should be ashamed of yourself. 
   Don't you know how to behave in a consulate?
   
   MAGICIAN
   great artist must find a way to make a living.
   
   SECRETARY
   
   MAGDA
   Any news for me?
   
   SECRETARY
   What is your name?
   
   MAGDA
   Don't you remember me?
   
   SECRETARY
   And why should I remember you?
   
   MAGDA
   But my name is Sorel.
   Magda Sorel!
   
   SECRETARY
   Oh, yes, here it is... Sorel... I remember now. 
   
   
   Did you bring the missing documents? 
   
   MAGDA
   But I've already told you.
   I cannot possibly get all those documents you want. 
   They won't give them to me.
   
   SECRETARY
   What do you expect us to do, then?
   
   MAGDA
   Documents or no documents!
    I must get away. 
   The Secret Police are after me. 
   Day after day they come to my house, 
   questioning, threatening. 
   I am too alone to fight any longer. 
   Can't you see, you've got to help me!
   
   SECRETARY
   We're very interested in your case, believe me. 
   But first you must get all of your papers.
   
   MAGDA
   But surely the Consul could make an exception. 
   Please, please, just let me speak to him... 
   
   SECRETARY
   It would be useless, Mrs. Sorel.
   
   MAGDA
   But I must speak to him! 
   
   SECRETARY
   It would be useless, Mrs. Sorel, believe me.
   
   MAGDA
   Let me explain to him. He'll understand.
   
   SECRETARY
   You're not the only one, Mrs. 
   Sorel, there are thousands of cases like yours.
   
   MAGDA
   Must we all die, then,       because there are too many of us?
   
   SECRETARY
   All I can promise is that we'll do our best. 
   We'd like to help you, but we need time.
   
   MAGDA
   If you can help me, it must be now, today!
   
   SECRETARY
   That is impossible. We must have time to think. 
   Your case is difficult, and most irregular!
   
   MAGDA
   
   SECRETARY
   Mrs. Sorel! Mrs. Sorel!
   If you behave like this       I must ask you to leave! 
   
   MAGDA
   To this we've come:       that men withhold the world from men. 
   No ship nor shore for him who drowns at sea. 
   No home nor grave for him who dies on land. 
   To this we've come:       that man be born a stranger upon God's earth, 
   that he be chosen without a chance for choice, 
   that he be hunted without the hope of refuge.       To this we've come.    
   And you, you too shall weep! 
   If to men, not to God, we now must pray, 
   tell me, Secretary, tell me, 
   who are these men? 
   If to them, not to God, we now must pray... 
   Who are these dark archangels? 
   Will they be conquered? Will they be doomed? 
   Is there one, anyone behind those doors 
   to whom the heart can still be explained? 
   Is there one, anyone, who still may care? 
   Tell me, Secretary, tell me!   
   Have you ever seen the Consul? 
   Does he speak, does he breathe?Have you spoken to him?   
   VERA, KOFNER
   Oh, do we hope and wait in vain? 
   Secretary speak! Is there no one in that room?
   
   SECRETARY
   I don't know what you're talking about! 
   Of course you can see the Consul. 
   But he's a very busy man.

   ASSAN
   Oh, I didn't see you.
   
   MAGDA
   What is it, what is it?
   
   ASSAN
   We must be careful. Wait...    
   
   MAGDA
   It is about John, isn't it? 
   
   ASSAN
   Yes, it is about John.
   
   MAGDA
   Why, what has happened?
   
   ASSAN
   We're very worried.
   
   MAGDA
   But why, why?
   
   ASSAN
   We heard that he wants to come back.
   That he's about to cross the frontier.
   
   MAGDA
   But he can't, he mustn't'! 
   
   ASSAN
   I know.
   
   MAGDA
   They'll get him. 
   
   ASSAN
   He heard about the baby.
   
   MAGDA
   But who told him? 
   
   ASSAN
   I don't know. He heard about his mother.
   
   MAGDA
   Oh, poor John.

   MAGDA
   Doesn't he know that the house is watched?
   
   ASSAN
   We told him, but he won't listen. 
   All he says is that he must come back to see you again.
   
   MAGDA
   Have you told him that every move I make is noted?
   
   ASSAN
   We told him everything. There is no reasoning with him. 
   
   MAGDA
   But we must try to stop him. 
   Help me, Assan! Help me!    
   
   ASSAN
   If he's arrested, it is the end of us all.
   It is the end of everything. 
   You must do something, Mrs. Sorel. 
   You must find a way to stop him.
   
   MAGDA
   Yes, yes, I have an idea. 
   I've had it for some time. Wait.

   MAGDA
   I assure you, Assan, 
   that this note will convince John 
   that there is no more reason for him to come back... 
   
   ASSAN
   But why, what does it say
   
   MAGDA
   Don't ask, Assan, don't ask me. 
   Hurry on. We have no time to lose.
   
   ASSAN
   Oh, Mrs. Sorel, 
   if this works, we'll all be saved.

   It will work. You shall all be saved.

   Oh, well, she'll be back tomorrow. Goodbye.   
   Oh, those faces! All those faces! 
   They hang from the ceiling and the walls. 
   They wait for me all day long.
   They still will be here in the morning, 
   boneless, pale in the dusty sun. 
   One must try not to remember, one must not think. 
   Otherwise how can one do any work?    
   
   Oh, those names! All those names! 
   Why must there be so many names? 
   Their cases are all alike.    
   
   It's getting late. 
   I must hurry or I'll miss the pictures. Ah, those faces!
   All those faces! It's cold in here. 
   I must complain to the janitor.   
   SECRETARY

   SECRETARY
   She left here a few minutes ago.
   
   JOHN
   Oh, no, no!
   
   SECRETARY
   If you hurry, you may catch up with her.
   
   JOHN
   But I can't, don't you understand?
   
   SECRETARY
   But why, why can't you? 
   
   JOHN
   Why? Because it is too late! 
   They've tracked me down. 
   They're outside the building waiting for me. 
   Here I am safe.
   
   SECRETARY
   But we are closing now. I cannot keep you here.
   
   JOHN
   You're not going to send me outside.
   
   SECRETARY
   I have no authority to keep you here. 
   I'll get into trouble.
   
   JOHN
   But where can I go now?
   
   SECRETARY
   Back there, there is a door leading to an alley. 
   No one will see you go out from there.
   
   JOHN
   But tell me, where is my wife? What did she say?
   
   SECRETARY
   Nothing. She was here... forgot her handbag.
   
   JOHN
   Her handbag? Where is it? Give it to me!   
   SECRETARY
   You must go now. Please, Mr. Sorel.   
   You cannot arrest him here. 
   It is against all international rules!
   
   POLICE AGENT
   Mr. Sorel will come with us of his own free will. 
   Isn't it true, Mr. Sorel?
   
   JOHN
   At least allow me to call up my wife.
   
   POLICE AGENT
   You can do it at headquarters.   
   SECRETARY
   Don't be afraid, Mr. Sorel.
   Something will be done about this. 
   I'll speak to the Consul first thing tomorrow morning.    
   Don't lose heart, Mr. Sorel.
   I'll call your wife myself.
